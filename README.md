## Local Development

### Overview

- Local development happens via docker-compose
- Django and django-rest-framework backend; the backend and frontend aren't fully decoupled, only three pages (Anxiety,
  Gratitude, and Journal use Vue.js SFCs)
- Postgres as the DB
- Celery worker for tasks and Celery Beat for task scheduling
- [Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Celery monitoring/management
- Redis as a message broker for Celery
- Vite dev server (HMR client) for Typescript, Tailwind, and Vue.js SFCs (all pre-compiled and statically served in
  prod)
- [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) for local email testing

### Getting Started With Local Development

- Install docker and
  docker-compose ([helpful blog](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04))


- Create an empty .allauth file

```sh
touch .envs/.local/.allauth
```

- Install pre-commit

https://pre-commit.com/#install

- Once pre-commit is installed, run

```sh
pre-commit install
```

- Start the development environment

```sh
docker compose --file local.yml up --build -d
```
